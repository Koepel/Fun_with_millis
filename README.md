# Fun_with_millis
A few small Arduino examples using the millis() function.

The Arduino millis() function can be used in almost every situation.
These are a few small demonstration sketches to show how to use millis() in different situations.


 - millis_basic_demo.ino  
   This is the basic example. It uses the serial monitor and no extra hardware is required.
   Three different software timers with millis are used to send something to the serial monitor.
